\title{Download TorchScript model component for Stable Diffusion}
\usage{
download_component(
  model_name = "sd21",
  component,
  device = "cpu",
  overwrite = FALSE,
  show_progress = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{model_name}{Character string, the name of the model to download (e.g., `"sd21"`).}

\item{component}{Character string, the specific model component to download (e.g., `"unet"`, `"decoder"`, `"text_encoder"`).}

\item{device}{Character string, the device type for which the model is intended (e.g., `"cpu"` or `"cuda"`).}

\item{overwrite}{Logical; if `TRUE`, re-downloads the model files even if they already exist.}

\item{show_progress}{Logical; if `TRUE` (default), displays a progress bar during download.}
}
\value{
The local file path to the specific model directory (as a string).
}
\description{
Downloads the required model file (e.g., UNet, decoder, text encoder, and tokenizer)
for a given Stable Diffusion model into a local user-specific data directory.
The files will be stored in a persistent path returned by [tools::R_user_dir()], typically:
\itemize{
\item macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/diffuseR/`
\item Linux: `~/.local/share/R/diffuseR/`
\item Windows: `C:/Users/<username>/AppData/Local/diffuseR/`
}
Each model is stored in its own subdirectory for better organization.
If the files already exist, they will not be downloaded again unless `overwrite = TRUE`.
