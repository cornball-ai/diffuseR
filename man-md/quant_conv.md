### Quant Conv

#### Description

This function applies a quantized convolution operation to an input tensor. It is typically used in the context of image processing, particularly in generative models like Stable Diffusion.

#### Usage

```r
quant_conv(x, dtype, device)
```

#### Arguments

- **`x`**: Input tensor to be processed.
- **`dtype`**: Data type for the tensor (e.g., "torch_float16" or "torch_float32").
- **`device`**: Device on which the tensor is located (e.g., "cpu" or "cuda").

#### Value

Processed tensor after applying the quantized convolution.
