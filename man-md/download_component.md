### Download TorchScript model component for Stable Diffusion

#### Description

Downloads the required model file (e.g., UNet, decoder, text encoder, and tokenizer) for a given Stable Diffusion model into a local user-specific data directory. The files will be stored in a persistent path returned by [tools::R_user_dir()], typically: \itemize{ \item macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/diffuseR/` \item Linux: `~/.local/share/R/diffuseR/` \item Windows: `C:/Users/<username>/AppData/Local/diffuseR/` } Each model is stored in its own subdirectory for better organization. If the files already exist, they will not be downloaded again unless `overwrite = TRUE`.

#### Usage

```r
download_component(model_name, component, device, overwrite, show_progress)
```

#### Arguments

- **`model_name`**: Character string, the name of the model to download (e.g., `"sd21"`).
- **`component`**: Character string, the specific model component to download (e.g., `"unet"`, `"decoder"`, `"text_encoder"`).
- **`device`**: Character string, the device type for which the model is intended (e.g., `"cpu"` or `"cuda"`).
- **`overwrite`**: Logical; if `TRUE`, re-downloads the model files even if they already exist.
- **`show_progress`**: Logical; if `TRUE` (default), displays a progress bar during download.

#### Value

The local file path to the specific model directory (as a string).

#### Examples

```r
model_dir <- download_model("sd21")
```
