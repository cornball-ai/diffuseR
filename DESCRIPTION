Description: A native R implementation of diffusion models providing a functional 
    interface to state-of-the-art generative AI. Inspired by Hugging Face's Python 
    'diffusers' library, 'diffuseR' allows users to generate and manipulate images 
    using text prompts through models like Stable Diffusion without Python dependencies. 
    The package provides a streamlined, idiomatic R experience with support for multiple 
    diffusion schedulers and device acceleration.
